# Kalman-Filter
An implementation of the Kalman filter for the following scenario 
The projectile motion (parabolic path) - the object moves in a curved path, initially ascending and then descending, forming a symmetrical shape resembling a parabola. The key characteristics of projectile motion include an initial velocity, launch angle, and the effects of gravity.
